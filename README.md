<p> In the Logical Workspace, the following devices were deployed:

PC: Simulates a standard wired workstation.

Laptop: Represents a portable device requiring wireless connectivity.

Cable Modem: Facilitates internet access.

Each device was added from their respective categories in Packet Tracer and positioned logically within the workspace.</p>

<br />
<br />
Step 2: Connecting Devices:  <br/>

Connections were established using appropriate cables:

PC to Wireless Router: Copper straight-through cable.

Wireless Router to Cable Modem: Copper straight-through cable.

Cable Modem to Internet Cloud: Coaxial cable.

These connections mimic a real-world scenario where end devices and network infrastructure communicate through wired and wireless mediums.
<br />
<br />
Configuring the PC: <br/>

<br />
<br />

Summary

This project illustrates foundational networking skills critical for cybersecurity roles, such as configuring and verifying networks while maintaining clear documentation. The ability to execute these tasks reflects preparedness for real-world scenarios and emphasizes the importance of organized workflows in cybersecurity environments.


<p> Key Observations:

- Devices received IPs in the 192.168.0.x range, confirming DHCP functionality.

- Subnet masks and gateways matched standard configurations, supporting efficient communication.
